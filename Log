# Algorithm
1. Take a picture of a test
2. Run OCR Lib (probablyy google cloud vision)
3. Run Compiler to find Syntax errors
4. Record Syntax errors (missing semicolon, etc.)
5. Smart fix syntax errors
6. Run compiler
7. Record all run-time errors (null pointer, etc.)

# --- END HACKATHON ---
For DDobervich:
Algorithm:
1. display one test with no answered questions (plain test)
2. ddobercich drags cursor across all places that answers will be marked
  - first dragging is for first answer
  - second dragging is for second answer
  - etc
3. Loop through all answer regions, display each with a textbox for comments
4. After looped through all pages, generate a class report with all the problems and corresponding comments
5. generate individual reports

# --- BUGS ---
Loop continues, after performing operations on all files, temporarily fixed with System.exit()
can't exit while loops without printing something
JOptionPane sometimes not allowing input
